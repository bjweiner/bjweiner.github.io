<h1><center> Steward / NOIRLab Galaxy Group <center></center></center></h1>
<br>

<p>
Galaxy Group brings together people at Steward and NOIRLab
broadly interested in galaxies, from galactic structure to 
extragalactic astronomy to cosmology. Talks
about any aspect of interest to this audience are welcome.
If you interested in giving a talk 
please email Ben Weiner, bjweiner at arizona.edu.

<p>

Galaxy Group for the 2025 Fall semester will host mostly
in-person talks, also broadcast from a Steward zoom room,
depending on circumstances.  Speakers from outside Arizona are welcome.
Remote talks are possible depending on schedule, but we are trying to
have more in-person events.
The regular time is on alternate Mondays at 12-1 pm MST.  Changes 
to the schedule may happen occasionally to accommodate speaker
schedules.
Talks are every 2nd week, occasionally with talks in the "off" weeks as well.
<p>

The aim is to provide a low key environment for people to 
discuss work in progress.  We can have one or two speakers per day, and talks
should be 20-25 minutes long to allow time for questions during and
after the talk.
Speakers are strongly urged to present work in a less formal
manner to encourage more discussion and interaction with the
audience.  Work in progress and talks that have a list of open
questions are encouraged, as are reports from conferences, etc.
